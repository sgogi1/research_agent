      "body": "The Ford Ranger models available in Australia demonstrate a concerted effort to balance performance with environmental considerations, particularly through fuel efficiency improvements and the introduction of hybrid technology. Fuel consumption across the 2025 Ranger range varies significantly by engine type and configuration, with reported combined fuel economy figures ranging from as low as 2.9 L/100km for the plug-in hybrid variant to upwards of 11.5 L/100km for some petrol and diesel models[2][6]. This wide range reflects the diversity of powertrains offered, including traditional diesel and petrol engines alongside a new plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) option.\n\nThe PHEV Ranger, launched for the Australian market in mid-2025, integrates a 2.3L turbocharged EcoBoost petrol engine with a 75 kW electric motor, delivering a combined output of 207 kW and 697 Nm of torque. This hybrid system enables multiple driving modes—pure electric, hybrid, and petrol-only—allowing for optimized fuel efficiency and reduced emissions during exploration and work tasks. The hybrid powertrain notably reduces fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions compared to conventional internal combustion engines, contributing to lower environmental impact while maintaining the Ranger's renowned utility and off-road capability[1][6].\n\nTraditional diesel and petrol engines in the Ranger lineup, including the 2.3L turbocharged four-cylinder and the twin-turbocharged 2.7L V6 petrol engines, offer fuel economy figures typically between 6.9 and 8.4 L/100km depending on variant and drivetrain configuration. These engines incorporate modern technologies such as direct fuel injection and auto start-stop systems to enhance efficiency and reduce emissions in line with Australian regulatory standards[2][3][4].\n\nIn terms of emissions, the adoption of the PHEV technology marks a significant step forward for Ford in meeting increasingly stringent Australian environmental regulations and consumer demand for greener vehicles. The hybrid Ranger's ability to operate in electric-only mode for short distances effectively reduces urban emissions, which is critical for minimizing environmental impact in sensitive or protected areas often encountered during Australian exploration.\n\nAdditionally, the Ranger Super Duty variant, while focused on heavy-duty performance, incorporates a large 130-litre fuel tank for extended range and is engineered with robust underbody protection, balancing operational durability with fuel management for remote and demanding conditions. Although primarily designed for payload and towing capacity enhancements, the Super Duty's design also considers fuel efficiency through optimized powertrain calibration and drivetrain options[5].\n\nOverall, Ford's strategy for the Ranger in Australia reflects a progressive integration of hybrid technology alongside efficient conventional engines, aiming to reduce fuel consumption and emissions without compromising the vehicle's ruggedness and versatility required for exploration and industrial applications. This approach aligns with broader automotive trends towards sustainability and regulatory compliance in the Australian market.",
