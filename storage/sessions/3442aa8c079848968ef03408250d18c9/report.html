      RESEARCH REPORT: HORNSBY NSW PROPERTY MARKET<br/>
Last Updated: 2023<br/>
<br/>
BACKGROUND<br/>
• Hornsby is a major suburban center located 19km northwest of Sydney CBD<br/>
• Historically developed as a railway junction town in the late 1800s<br/>
• Serves as administrative center of Hornsby Shire Council<br/>
• Known for bushland setting and position as gateway to Sydney's upper North Shore<br/>
<br/>
CURRENT STATE<br/>
Housing Stock & Prices<br/>
• Median house price: Approximately $1.6-1.8M (2023)<br/>
• Median unit price: Approximately $750,000-850,000<br/>
• Mix of housing types: Free-standing homes (60%), apartments (35%), townhouses (5%)<br/>
<br/>
Market Characteristics<br/>
• Strong transport links (rail junction, multiple bus routes)<br/>
• Major shopping/commercial center<br/>
• Well-regarded schools and healthcare facilities<br/>
• High proportion of owner-occupiers<br/>
• Growing appeal to young families priced out of lower North Shore<br/>
<br/>
KEY DEBATES<br/>
Development vs. Conservation<br/>
• Tension between increased density and environmental preservation<br/>
• Council planning controls balancing growth with heritage protection<br/>
• Debate over appropriate height limits for new developments<br/>
<br/>
Infrastructure Capacity<br/>
• Questions about infrastructure keeping pace with population growth<br/>
• Parking pressures in town center<br/>
• School capacity concerns<br/>
<br/>
RISKS & LIMITATIONS<br/>
Market Vulnerabilities<br/>
• Interest rate sensitivity due to high mortgage levels<br/>
• Dependent on Sydney's broader economic performance<br/>
• Infrastructure bottlenecks during peak hours<br/>
<br/>
Geographic Constraints<br/>
• Bushfire risk in some areas<br/>
• Limited expansion potential due to national parks<br/>
• Topographical challenges for new development<br/>
<br/>
POTENTIAL FUTURE DIRECTIONS<br/>
• Continued apartment development near transport hub<br/>
• Focus on "missing middle" housing types<br/>
• Potential for commercial office expansion<br/>
• Enhanced retail/hospitality precincts<br/>
• Implementation of Hornsby Town Center masterplan<br/>
