      # Co-living Property Investment Market in Point Cook, Victoria: 2024–2025 Research Report<br/>
<br/>
## Background<br/>
<br/>
Point Cook, located in Melbourne’s western suburbs, has evolved from a largely undeveloped area into one of Victoria’s most prominent residential estates. Over the past two decades, the suburb has seen the rise of more than 16 master-planned communities, each offering a mix of housing types, amenities, and lifestyle features. The area is now fully developed, with limited new land supply, making it a mature market for property investment. Point Cook’s proximity to Melbourne’s CBD, major employment hubs, and its integration with public transport (including the Westgate Tunnel) have contributed to its appeal among young professionals, families, and students.<br/>
<br/>
Co-living, a housing model that blends private living spaces with shared amenities and communal areas, has gained traction in Australia as a response to rising housing costs, urbanization, and changing lifestyle preferences. In Point Cook, co-living developments are emerging as part of broader mixed-use and multi-residential projects, often targeting young professionals, students, and downsizers seeking affordable, flexible, and community-oriented living arrangements.<br/>
